            1- Make a request to the Deck of Cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, console.log the value and the suit (e.g. “5 of spades”, “queen of diamonds”).
        </p>
        <ul style="color: blanchedalmond;" id="request1"></ul>
         <p class="c">
            2- Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, make a request to the same API to get one more card from the same deck.
            Once you have both cards, console.log the values and suits of both cards.
        </p>
        <ul style="color: blanchedalmond;" id="request2"></ul>
         <p class="c">
           3- Build an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck.
